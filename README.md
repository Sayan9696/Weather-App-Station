# Weather-App-Station
It's a Simple Weather Application developed by me using HTML, CSS3, JavaScript & OpenWeatherMap API.

This weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18¬∞C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city. This Application will provide you the weather forecast for upcoming 8 days with proper description. OpenWeatherMap is a service that provides various weather data through API. We integrate the API into our app and use the data on our website.
